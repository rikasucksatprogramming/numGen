Simple Number guessing game. 

Enter your number guess, and it will give you feedback.
It will tell you wheather your number is too much or too little, and if you get it correct. 

Took about 45 minutes to build this cuz Im a dummy, but it was just me and my regaeton.

Future Update: Add a limit on how many tries someone can have.
              Make a better design with like either react or tailwind.cs cuz I'm trying to become full stack
